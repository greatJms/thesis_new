\section{\ourtechnique: Transforming Object Sensitivity to Call-Site Sensitivity}\label{sec:technique}
We now present our technique, \ourtechnique. 
Given an object-sensitive analysis specified by an arbitrary
tunneling policy $\objheuristic$, our technique transforms it to another
tunneling policy $\callheuristic$
%\[
%\objheuristic \to \mbox{\ourtechnique} \to \callheuristic
%\]
such that the
call-site-sensitive analysis with $\callheuristic$ becomes more precise
than the baseline object-sensitive analysis with $\objheuristic$. 

To achieve this, \ourtechnique~works in the two steps: simulation and learning. 
It first converts $\objheuristic$ into
a {\em simulated policy} $\simheuristic$. 
%\[
%    \objheuristic \to \mbox{Simulation} \to \simheuristic
%\]
With $\simheuristic$, call-site sensitivity becomes
more precise than object sensitivity with $\objheuristic$
but running the analysis with $\simheuristic$
is expensive as it uses the baseline
object-sensitive analysis as a pre-analysis. 
The purpose of the second step is to  remove this overhead
 by learning the behavior of $\simheuristic$ from training data.  
%\[
%  \begin{array}{r}
%%    \simheuristic \to\\[0.1em]
%   \simheuristic +  \mbox{training data} \to
%  \end{array}
%  \mbox{Learning} \to \callheuristic \qquad\qquad
%\]
The learned policy $\callheuristic$ is as precise as
$\simheuristic$ but more efficient as it does not rely on the
simulation procedure.
