%the high-level idea of our approach could be adapted for m-CFA and we think it will be an interesting direction for extending our work.
%Our current simulation technique relies on specific properties of k-CFA (e.g., I_2I 2â€‹	
%leverages a unique property of context-tunneled k-CFA). Therefore applying our technique as it is may not be effective for m-CFA [2].
