This thesis presents data-driven pointer analysis, a novel approach for automatically generating analysis heuristics that make pointer analysis precise and scalable. 
Pointer analysis is a fundamental program analysis technique that has wide application in diverse software engineering tools. The success of the engineering tools is eventually dependent on the quality of the underlying pointer analysis.
However, developing a qualified pointer analysis is challenging.
A cost-effective pointer analysis requires good analysis heuristics such as context-sensitivity and heap abstraction heuristics.
However, developing qualified analysis heuristics is a non-trivial and laborious task even for the experts. Furthermore, the manually designed heuristics often end up with suboptimal results in practice.
To address this problem, we present data-driven pointer analysis that automatically generates good analysis heuristics.
Our experimental results show that our data-driven pointer analysis successfully produced qualified heuristics that make the pointer analysis precise and scalable.
