This thesis explore data-driven pointer analysis, a novel technique for generating analysis heuristics that make pointer analysis precise and scalable. 
To this end, we present three key ideas: data-driven context tunneling, \ourtechnique, \Graphick. We present context tunneling that shifts the context abstraction paradigm from the most recent $k$ into the most important $k$.
Data-driven context tunneling automatically generates qualified tunneling heuristics that enable the pointer analysis to keep important $k$ context elements. \ourtechnique~challenged the commonly accepted knowledge, object sensitivity is superior to call-site sensitivity for object-oriented programs. \ourtechnique~automatically transforms an object sensitivity into a more precise call-site sensitivity. We present \Graphick~to remove the burden of designing features. \Graphick~automatically learns graph-based heuristics without application-specific features. The evaluation results show that the automatically generated analysis heuristics significantly improved the precision and scalability of pointer analysis.

% We studied {\em data-driven symbolic execution}, a brand new solution for
% the difficulty of manually crafting critical techniques of symbolic
% execution: search heuristic, input space reduction, and state-pruning.
% The key idea of our data-driven approach is to
% automatically learn how to generate a promising solution based on data (e.g.,
% test-cases) accumulated during symbolic execution. Experimental results show
% that this ``machine-tuned'' technique outperforms existing ``hand-tuned''
% techniques in both code coverage and bug detection on a wide range of
% open-source C programs. We hope that our data-driven approach can supplant
% the laborious and less rewarding task of manually generating diverse
% heuristics of symbolic execution.

% As future work, it would be possible to extend data-driven
% symbolic execution in two folds. First, we will continuously replace
% manually-tuned yet unstable techniques of symbolic execution (e.g., seed
% selection and parameter tuning) with automatically-tuned and stable ones via data-driven approach.
% Second, we will integrate four different techniques, including $\paradyse$,
% $\conmeleon$, $\contest$, and $\ourtool$, into a publicly available tool so
% that end-users can easily employ our technique.
